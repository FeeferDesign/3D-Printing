# Summary

This is a remix of the TUSH (The Ultimate Spool Holder) by _filamentry_ and hopefully answers the need many requested to have a way to:

- Keep the two sides of each holder together
- Make everything more stable
- Keep two holders a specific distance apart for different spool widths
- Allow you to keep more than one holder next to each other by interlocking them

V2 - I also added an interconnecting clip
V3 - Per a user request, I added a longer stabilizer

I did my best to meet his needs in the comments to "keep it sexy" as well.

# Print Settings

Printer: Tevo Tarantula
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Infill: 100

Notes: 
Consider setting *Horizontal Expansion* to -0.04 when printing the stabilizers.

# Custom Section

## Tolerances and Design

The tolerances are very tight (ahem... ok, they are zero), so when printing, you might want to set Horizontal Expansion to something like -0.02 or all the way up to -0.10 (YMMV) when printing the two stabilizers.  Let me know in the comments what number worked best for you.

I have included the _Fusion 360_ file (.f3d) as well, in case someone would like to further modify it.
